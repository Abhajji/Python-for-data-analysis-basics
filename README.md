Python for data analysis basics ( first steps to the world of analysis )
I am a industrial quality engineer with more than 4 years of experience, I figured out that analyzing is one of my strongest points and im willing to try if i will enjoy analyzing not in the industry field but this time in data analysis. 
After some research, it seems that python language could be a good asset to learn in order to become a data analyst.
